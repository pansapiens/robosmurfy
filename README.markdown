Robosmurfy - A little blue Google Wave Robot
============================================

Inspired by the <a href="http://websmurfer.devnull.net/">WebSmurfer</a>.

Just add robosmurfy@appspot.com to your Wave. Smurfy !

TODO:
---------------------
* Convert most (all?) substitutions to regexes, to deal with capitalization (eg House vs. house).

<del>* Prevent double substitution, eg: "This is some excellent prose" => "This smurfily is smurfily some excellent prose" => "This smurfily smurfily is smurfily smurfily some excellent prose".</del>

* Add "Smurftastic!" and "Smurfilicious!" after some sentences (analysis of the original WebSmurfer required to determine exactly where. "Smurftastic!" seems to appear after '' quotes).

* Further analyse output of the WebSmurfer to match subsititutions and behaviour more closely.
